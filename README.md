# Flutter TrillApp

TrillApp is made for flutter create contest unser 5KB of dart code. The purpose of the app is to share the data between devices offline using sound. Suppose, you are boarding a shuttle/bus/train, how easy it will be for you and the driver to hop you on using sound without internet on as single click.

There can be many use cases where you want to send some bytes of data but don't have any internet connection. So, Trill App is for you. It doesn't require any internet. For the purpose of explaining it, I have made this chat app where you can send some bytes of message using sound to other nearby devices.

- The App is running on both android & iOS real devices when I tested. Make sure to give microphone permission when it asks for it.
